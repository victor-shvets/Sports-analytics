    General information:

    dataflow slide:
    
    data cleaning process:
    
    why important:
    - predict number of goals for individual players
    - predict total goals for the team for the season
    - predict the champion and standing of all teams
    - predict number of goals if a player is transferred in a certain league or team
    - predict the same player but in a copule of years, so he gets older
    - player player played not many games but scored descent amount of goals, how much goals he will score if he plays all games?

Cleaning data:

    - description of the fields

Analytics:

    - find funny correlation but not causation, like 1:1 correlation of number of yellow cards and year of birth


Prediction:

    - analyze the reason for false positive/negative
    - predict goals for the current season based on the data for the current season and compare results
    - try to add ratings with much less number of rows
    - add total values for teams to players
    - add number of nationalities in a team
    - add total number of legioners in the team
    - take any player from new unseen league and try to predict the goals
    
Question:

    - can I use Kbest and PCA at the same time in gridsearch cv
    - grid search with pca and one hot encoding sparse matrix
    - I predict integers only, should I round the result or can I make model to predict int only
    - grive search cv, kbest and one hot encoding. each fold doesn't have all number of features but try all of them, failing
    - created model and performed cross validation on train, get the score on test?
